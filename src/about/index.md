## Hi There

Photos capture the memories we want to keep forever and often times it's extremely hard to find an affordable photographer to make it happen. I currently live in Santa Cruz County, but prior to making my home base here, I graduated from Cal State Northridge in Southern California with a degree in Photojournalism.
 
I would describe my style as documentary photography because I love capturing those beautiful raw, real moments and allowing the photos to tell the story.
 
I'm originally from the Sacramento area, but moving to Santa Cruz was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I love running into people and making new friends. The scenery, weather and people here are what inspire me most and are the main reasons why I love what I do. On the weekends you can find me with my camera and yellow lab in tow, exploring this beautiful place we are so lucky to live in!
 
Making you comfortable in front of the camera is very important to me. I also really enjoy creating lasting relationships so you know you have a photographer to come back to. Please feel free to contact me with any questions of information about pricing...

I look forward to hearing from you!
